# StudyTimer

###### Maintained by NOBODY YET

## About
This is a native phone app for study timing.  The basic idea is to create a timer that is modeled on the [pomodoro system](http://pomodorotechnique.com/), but the timer will only count down when the phone is face down. The goal is to prevent the user from being distracted by their phone while studying and only count time as productive if they aren't actively using their phone.

## Development Environment
* You will need to work in either [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html?gclid=COHO95XbnssCFQEdaQodZgEADA) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) but for Xcode you will need a Mac computer.
* If you're working with Android Studio, you will need to have [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed.  Xcode has everything for iOS development included.
* If you are doing Android and you don't want to use the slowest emulator on the planet, try [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/), it's faster.

## Style Guide
Google has a beautiful [style guide](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html) for Android development.  Know it.  Love it.  Use it.
If you want to develop for iOS, find your own guide and stick with it.  (We don't know, we're Android people.)

## Getting Started
The best place to start would be to learn to access the accelerometer data, and figure out how to make a simple timer app.  Then it's just a matter of linking the two and coming up with a great UI to seal it up! (And bug fixing.  Lots of bug fixing. Because native development is _great_.)
